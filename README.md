The Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon is a concept that explains how anyone in the Hollywood film industry can be connected to Kevin Bacon within six steps, where each step consists of finding a film that two actors both starred in. As such, I would like to find the shortest path between any two actors by choosing a sequence of movies that connects them. For example, the shortest path between Jennifer Lawrence and Tom Hanks is 2: Jennifer Lawrence is connected to Kevin Bacon by both starring in “X-Men: First Class,” and Kevin Bacon is connected to Tom Hanks by both starring in “Apollo 13.”

One of the preliminary problems with regards to understanding the concept of artificial intelligence is a program's ability to search for a solution through inference from information that is already given or that it already knows. This will be the first of a series of AI-related topics.
